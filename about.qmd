## Team Name: Pixels and Patterns

### **About This Project**

This project leverages the `f1dataR` package to conduct an in-depth analysis of Formula 1 racing data. The primary goal of the project is to explore key aspects of driver and team performance across various circuits and races. By utilizing real-world Formula 1 data, the project aims to create compelling visualizations and actionable insights for fans, analysts, and racing teams.

### **Objectives**

1.  Analyze performance trends for drivers and teams over the course of races and seasons.

2.  Investigate the impact of pit stop strategies, circuit characteristics, and race conditions on outcomes.

3.  Visualize telemetry data (e.g., speed, throttle, braking) to understand driver behavior and vehicle performance.

4.  Compare lap time improvements and team strategies across different circuit types.

5.  Create visually engaging and insightful plots to effectively communicate findings.

### **Key Features**

-   **Data Exploration**: Includes lap times, pit stops, telemetry, and race results for recent Formula 1 seasons.

-   **Visualization**: Generates intuitive plots to showcase performance trends, driver strategies, and circuit-specific dynamics.

-   **Insights**: Highlights critical factors influencing race outcomes, including team strategies and driver adaptability.

### **Technologies Used**

-   **Programming Language**: R

-   **Package**: `f1dataR` for accessing and analyzing Formula 1 data

-   **Visualization Tools**: `ggplot2` for creating plots and dashboards

-   **Version Control**: GitHub for managing project files and collaboration

### **Motivation**

Formula 1 combines engineering excellence, driver skill, and strategic decisions, making it a rich field for data analysis. This project is designed to uncover insights from F1 data, demonstrate advanced analytical techniques, and present findings in a visually appealing way.
